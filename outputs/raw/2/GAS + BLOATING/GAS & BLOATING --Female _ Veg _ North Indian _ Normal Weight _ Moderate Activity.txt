Dietary & Cultural Context
1. Dietary Context:
● The plan is vegetarian, aligned with the North Indian diet pattern, including cereals,
pulses, dairy, vegetables, and spices.
● Foods are low-FODMAP where possible (e.g., avoiding excessive onion, garlic, beans)
to reduce bloating and gas.
● Emphasis on warm, cooked foods, which are generally easier to digest in Indian
culinary traditions.
● Spices like cumin, fennel, ginger, and mint are included for digestive support and to
relieve bloating, consistent with Ayurvedic principles.
● Fermented dairy like curd and buttermilk is included for probiotics to support gut health.
2. Cultural Context:
● Uses locally available North Indian staples like wheat, rice, millet (ragi, foxtail millet),
bottle gourd (lauki), and moong dal.
● Cooking techniques reflect North Indian household methods: boiling, steaming,
sautéing with minimal oil.
● Snack choices (makhana, roasted nuts, papaya) align with Indian vegetarian snack
traditions.

● Herbal teas (fennel, tulsi, ginger) are culturally familiar and support digestion.
Rationale & Alternatives
Rationale for Food Choices:
1. Moong Dal, Khichdi, Soups → Light, easily digestible protein sources, low in
gas-producing compounds compared to chickpeas or rajma.
2. Warm Lemon Water with Fennel & Ginger → Stimulates digestion, reduces bloating.
3. Vegetables like Lauki, Zucchini, Carrots, Spinach → Soft-fiber vegetables, low in
FODMAPs, easy on digestion.
4. Roti & Millet-based dishes → Complex carbs for steady energy, gluten is included in
moderation (wheat) but balanced with easily digestible grains like millet.
5. Fermented foods (curd, buttermilk) → Provide probiotics to maintain gut flora, help
reduce bloating.
6. Avoidance of large amounts of beans, onion, garlic, cauliflower, cabbage → These
are gas-producing in sensitive individuals.
Alternatives for Flexibility:
● Rice → Quinoa or brown rice (for fiber and satiety).
● Moong Dal → Split red lentils (Masoor dal) (if tolerated).
● Vegetables → Pumpkin, Bottle gourd, Ridge gourd (if some veggies cause gas).
● Fennel/Herbal Tea → Chamomile or Ginger Tea (for variety and digestive aid).
● Roti → Bajra or Jowar Roti (for gluten-free option).
