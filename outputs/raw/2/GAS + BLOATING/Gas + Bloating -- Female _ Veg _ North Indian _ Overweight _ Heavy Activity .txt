Dietary & Cultural Context
● Diet Type: Vegetarian, North Indian cuisine
● Cultural Preference: Traditional North Indian flavors, moderate use of spices
● Health Focus: Reduce gas and bloating, improve digestion, manage weight
● Allergens / Restrictions: Dairy (milk, paneer), Gluten (wheat), Legumes (may cause
bloating if not soaked or cooked properly)
● Cooking Considerations: Use minimal oil, prefer steaming, boiling, or sautéing; avoid
fried and heavy creamy foods
Rationale & Alternatives
● Rationale:
○ Diet targets gut-friendly foods to reduce bloating (e.g., ginger, fennel, mint).
○ Includes easily digestible proteins like moong dal, paneer, tofu to support
satiety and weight management.
○ Incorporates low-FODMAP vegetables and fruits to minimize gas production.
○ High fiber foods in moderate amounts to improve digestion without causing
excessive bloating.
○ Avoids heavy legumes, carbonated drinks, and processed foods that exacerbate
gas.

Alternatives / Substitutions:
○ Paneer ↔ Tofu
○ Wheat Chapati ↔ Millet Roti / Oats Roti
○ Cow’s Milk ↔ Soy Milk / Almond Milk (unsweetened)
○ Garlic / Onion ↔ Asafoetida (hing) in small amounts for flavor without causing
gas
○ High-FODMAP vegetables (like cabbage, cauliflower) ↔ Low-FODMAP (carrot,
bottle gourd, pumpkin)
