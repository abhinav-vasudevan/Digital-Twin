Tips for Healthy Weight Gain + High Protein & Fiber
1. Include protein in every meal (dal, egg, paneer, tofu, milk) to build lean muscle.
2. Eat small, frequent meals (5–6 meals/day) to increase overall calorie intake.
3. Use healthy oils like coconut, sesame, or groundnut (cold-pressed) for extra calories
and essential fatty acids.
4. Include fiber-rich foods (millets, beans, vegetables) to improve digestion and prevent
bloating.
5. Engage in moderate activity or resistance training to promote muscle gain instead of
fat.
6. Drink water 20–30 minutes before meals, but not too much during meals to avoid
fullness.
7. Sleep 7–8 hours daily for proper metabolism and muscle recovery.
8. Avoid excessive fried or ultra-processed foods; prefer home-cooked meals.
9. Use portion control and gradual calorie increase to avoid digestive discomfort.
10. Be consistent for 8–12 weeks to notice sustainable weight gain and improved energy
levels.
Rationale
1. High Protein – Supports lean muscle gain, improves satiety, and helps meet daily
calorie needs for underweight individuals. Sources: moong dal, chana dal, paneer, eggs,
milk.
2. High Fiber – Improves digestion, supports gut health, and prevents constipation often
seen in sedentary underweight individuals. Sources: vegetables, fruits, millets, legumes.
3. Moderate Healthy Fats – Coconut, nuts, and seeds provide essential fatty acids and
calorie density for healthy weight gain.
4. Low-GI Carbohydrates – Millets, brown rice, and ragi maintain steady energy and
prevent insulin spikes.

5. South Indian Cuisine Adaptation – Uses familiar ingredients like ragi, idli, dosa,
millets, sambar, and curries for better adherence.
6. Meal Timing – Spacing meals 3–4 hours apart ensures sustained energy and better
nutrient absorption.
7. Calorie-Dense Snacks – Nuts, makhana, roasted chana, and coconut water help
increase calories without causing overeating.
