Tips for Healthy Weight Gain + High Protein & Fiber
1. Include protein in every meal (dal, egg, paneer, milk) to build lean muscle.
2. Eat small, frequent meals (5–6 meals/day) to increase calories gradually.
3. Use healthy oils (coconut, sesame, groundnut) for added calories and essential fatty
acids.
4. Include fiber-rich foods (millets, legumes, vegetables, fruits) to improve digestion.
5. Engage in resistance training or heavy activity to promote muscle gain.
6. Drink water 20–30 min before meals; avoid excess during meals.
7. Sleep 7–8 hours for muscle recovery and metabolism.
8. Avoid fried and ultra-processed foods; focus on home-cooked meals.
9. Track portion sizes for consistent weight gain.
10. Consistency for 8–12 weeks ensures results.
Rationale
● High protein supports muscle gain and satiety.
● High fiber improves digestion and prevents bloating.
● Moderate healthy fats provide calorie density and essential fatty acids.
● Low-GI carbs (millets, ragi, brown rice) maintain steady energy.
● South Indian cuisine adaptation increases adherence.
● Meal timing supports energy for heavy activity and nutrient absorption.
● Calorie-dense snacks support additional intake without excessive volume.
